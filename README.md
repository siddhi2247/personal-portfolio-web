# personal-portfolio-web
I created a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes sections for my skills, projects, services, and contact information. The site is mobile-friendly and has features like a navigation menu, tabs to switch between content, and links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and resume.
